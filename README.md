# Music Page

I want to create a project based on something to do with music as it has been a huge part of my life. I have been making and listening to music for as long as I can remember so this is something I am passionate about.

This project will be to create a pomodoro application that integrates spotify to play music as well as ambient sounds. This will be useful firstly to me as I often use the pomodoro technique with my workflow. As well as this, lo-fi hip hop has gone a long way in being able to allow me to stay productive while having something enjoyable on in the background.

# Necessities:

. First and foremost the page has to be clean and free from distractions. This is a pomodoro timer so it should elevate your workflow rather than stop you from working.

. The page should be clean and calming

. The page needs to be able to interface with spotify in a clean way allowing for the user to simply press play on a playlist and start working.

. The page should play lo-fi hip hop when the user is working and ambient sounds when it is breaktime. This will create a flow for the user to expect which will allow them to easily get back to work when the music starts up.

. The page should allow the user to change the pomodoro times and the break times.

# Nice to Haves:

. The background of the page should change based on whats playing. Try first to change between lo-fi playlist and then ambient sounds playlist. After try to change on each song, possibly using the album photos shown on each song.
